A little about me
-----------------

I grew up in Richmond, VA. As a child I was always proficient in drawing and painting. My goal growing up was to be an architect and maybe create a comic book series on the side. I attended two high schools. Half of the day I took regular courses and the other half I went to a technical school. There, I learned how to draft and use AutoCad. I also increased my knowledge of the graphic arts in my spare time.

Upon graduation I was accepted into Brown University to study the history of art and architecture. I would also attend the Rhode Island School of Design to study architecture. *They shared the same campus*.

However, the summer after my senior year in high school, I was approached by a modeling agent to move to NYC and work. I thought that I could make both work but the work as a model was too much. I was in New York city all the time. I ended up leaving Brown and moving to NYC to study marketing at the City College of New York. I wanted to better understand the industry that lured me away from the Ivy League. I then spent the next twelve years traveling as a model and actor while doing graphic arts on the side.

Last spring I decided to build a video game for my son. Other than AutoCad and a few graphic design programs, I had zero technical experience. I made all the art and was using GameSalad to run the actions. As I got into the project I found that some of my ideas where out of the scope of GS. I also felt like I was cheating in a way. I decided that I wanted to build a computer and learn how to develop programs. I also wanted a skill to pass on to my son other than being a performer. A professor at the UW told me about Code Fellows and here I am.

###That's all for now.
